## Leadership

{{% lede-initial %}}Great leaders are not born — they are shaped by the challenges they face and grow thanks to the insights they gain. While the challenges show up all by themselves, insights can be acquired deliberately.

If you think that a leader's role is to motivate their team and that empowerment is the key, you're not alone. Most leaders in large organizations develop their views on effective leadership based on personal experience. These leaders often pride themselves on how they act differently when in a leadership position.{{% /lede-initial %}}

However, this method of growth is limited to the leader's exposure, and there is a tendency to get stuck in a loop.

Broadening our perspectives to include leaders in vastly different environments can accelerate our growth and introduce us to alternative approaches to leadership.

Two models of leadership I find effective are **intent-based leadership** and **leadership based on freedom and responsibility**. Both challenge traditional paradigms.

### Intent-based leadership: empowering team members

L. David Marquet brought forth a leadership model that moves away from the traditional leader-follower dynamic. In a high-pressure submarine environment, he found that empowering each team member to take responsibility led to enhanced performance.

{{< panel page="/leadership/turn-the-ship-around-l-david-marquet" float=right relativewidth=30 >}}

In his [book *Turn the Ship Around!*](leadership/turn-the-ship-around-l-david-marquet), Marquet reveals how giving control, rather than taking it, and focusing on competence and clarity can unlock individual potential. This fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

Dive deeper into these transformative ideas with practical tools and techniques for implementing intent-based leadership.

### Leadership based on freedom and responsibility: unlocking adult potential

From Netflix's journey, we learn the importance of treating employees as empowered adults. In her [book *Powerful*](leadership/powerful-patty-mccord), Patty McCord discusses how a culture based on trust and responsibility can lead to astonishing results.

In particular, McCord walks us through Netflix's radical corporate culture, emphasizing transparency, open communication, and shared goals.

## Organizational transformation

{{% lede-initial %}}What sets great organizations apart? The ability to focus, align and boldly move toward their goals.

The operative words here are *focus* and *goals*. I have yet to see an organization whose leaders think that they lack goals or a strategy. What is rare, though, are organizations that achieve their goals and realize the benefits promised by their strategy. {{% /lede-initial %}}

{{< panel page="/transformation/how-objectives-key-results-facilitate-transformation" float=right relativewidth=30 >}}

### Achieving the benefits promised by strategy

In the modern business landscape, strategic choices are crucial. Deciding, what to do is easy. What is hard is to decide, what *not* to do. 

I have seen first hand, how [OKRs facilitate strategic choices at all levels of the organization](transformation/how-objectives-key-results-facilitate-transformation) in full alignment with the organization's strategy.

### Employee engagement

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) have been successfully implemented by tech industry giants like Google, LinkedIn, and Twitter. But you probably already knew that. 

Even if you have looked at OKRs before, I invite you to take a fresh perspective and as I want to share with you, how [OKRs fuel employee engagement](transformation/why-okr-objectives-key-results-already-have-goals).

{{< /panel >}}

{{< panel page="/transformation/okrs-vs-performance-management" float=right relativewidth=30 >}}

### Performance management

Embarking on an organizational transformation demands courage, vision and clarity.

Every individual deserves to have clarity regarding the following three key questions:

1. What do you expect from me?
2. How do you see my performance relative to these  expectations?
3. What does my future hold?

While OKRs answer the first question, number two and three are at best answered partially by OKRs and belong to the [separate realm of performance management](transformation/okrs-vs-performance-management).

OKRs act as your compass, guiding you through unfamiliar territory, ensuring alignment and promoting adaptability. Ready for deeper insights? Explore the articles above and begin your transformation journey.
