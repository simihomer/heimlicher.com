Over the past ten years, I have had the privilege to gain valuable insights from some of the most accomplished leaders in the fields of **leadership,** **organizational transformation,** and **strategy execution at a global scale.** 

These experiences have been gained through my work with companies ranging from [small startups](https://nine.ch/) to [global wealth managers](https://www.ubs.com).

## Unleashing potential

During this time, I have developed a passion for assisting my colleagues in unleashing more of their potential, regardless of their background, organizational role, or age.

I firmly believe that leadership is more crucial now than ever, especially given the rapid pace of change in fields such as [machine learning](/research/machine-learning).

## Trusted advisor

I feel particularly honored when aspiring leaders reach out to me for guidance and advice, especially when they face new and particularly difficult situations. I take great pleasure in sharing my insights on leadership and transformation through my writings and recommendations of books, which can be found on my website.

I am an avid reader and like to captures my insights of books on [leadership and transformation](/categories/book) on this website.

As someone who is always seeking new challenges and opportunities to evolve my thinking, I encourage you to contact me at {{< obfuscated-email >}} to share your own thoughts and ideas.
