Over the past ten years, I have had the privilege to gain valuable insights from some of the most accomplished leaders in the fields of **leadership,** **organizational transformation,** and **strategy execution at a global scale.** 

These experiences have been gained through my work with companies ranging from [startups](https://stimmt.ch/) to [multi-national banks](https://www.ubs.com).

## Hidden potential

During this time, I have developed a passion for assisting my colleagues in unleashing more of their potential, regardless of their background, organizational role, or age.

I firmly believe that leadership is more crucial now than ever, especially given the rapid pace of change in fields such as [machine learning](/research/machine-learning).

## Sparring partner for leaders

I feel particularly honored when aspiring leaders reach out to me for guidance and advice, especially when they face new and particularly difficult situations. I take great pleasure in sharing my insights on leadership and transformation through my writings and recommendations of books, which can be found on my website.

I am an avid reader and like to share my insights from books on topics such as [leadership and transformation](/categories/book) on this website.

As someone who is always seeking new challenges and opportunities to evolve my thinking, I encourage you to {{< obfuscated-email "share your thoughs with me" >}}.
