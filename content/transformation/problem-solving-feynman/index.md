A key competency is **decomposing complex problems** and **rallying teams** to address their **root cause** in a **structured manner.** In my experience, the most challening step in addressing the root cause of a problem is often the definition of the problem in the first place.

A simple — yet far from easy —, step-by-step approach is attributed to [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman):

> 1. Write down the problem.
> 2. Think very hard.
> 3. Write down the solution.
