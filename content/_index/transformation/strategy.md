The difference between organizations that thrive and those who struggle is rarely a matter of luck or favorable circumstances. Rather, it is the rare but crucial ability to say *no*.

While everyone gets behind a call to *focus*, I prefer the clarity of the expression *to say no*. One way to determine what to say no to are [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](/transformation/why-okr-objectives-key-results-already-have-goals/). As opposed to methods such as [Management by Objectives (MBO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_Objectives), the [OKR methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) limits the number of objectives to five and asks organizations to *say no to everything else*.

What is often forgotten is that OKRs were born out of necessity. In the late 1970s, Intel decided to *say no* to everything other than selling the product they had available, the [8088 microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088). Despite the limitations of this product, Intel launched the now legendary *Operation Crush* to once and for all defeat Motorola.
