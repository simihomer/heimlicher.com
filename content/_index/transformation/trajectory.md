It’s not a few lucky punches — but rather what we do every day that determines our fate. But as with other widely-accepted truths, the actions of us humans unfortunately do not correlate with our stated beliefs. One sad example is the state of *performance management*.

While the name of this common practice suggests that something — performance — is managed, most leaders think about it about three times a year. Since the observable impact of performance management is typically as small as one could expect from something they deal with three times a year, their view of performance management not adding value is confirmed. While Objective and Key Results (OKR) can be part of performance conversations, the two [should be kept separate](/transformation/okrs-vs-performance-management/).
