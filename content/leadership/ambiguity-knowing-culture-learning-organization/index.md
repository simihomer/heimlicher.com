title: Ambiguity kills action in a knowing culture
---




An organization’s culture manifests the behavior that has met people’s desires in the past. 
A particularly treacherous – yet common – culture is referred to in Martin G. Moore’s book *No Bullsh!t Leadership* as a “knowing culture”.

How would you expect the culture to evolve toward in an organization given the following parameters:
1. Turnover has been far below 10% for more than a decade
2. There has been only gradual change in the past decade
3. All employees and leaders have been rated with the equivalent of “met expectations” or “exceeded expectations”
 
Let’s further assume that – as compared to the labor market – the competencies of employees followed a Gaussian distribution a decade ago.

What might have happened with the low and high end as well as the middle?

Both the department leader and the division leader have been fired and the department leader has let everyone know that there will be a period of transformation for the upcoming four years
The threat of transformation becomes tangible in the form of a growing pile of deficiencies identified by external audit and the department has failed to address them by the deadline they agreed on with the auditor

## Diagnosis
What kind of culture could be at play here? Hubris and a lack of self-awareness that leads to decisions either being missed or taken based on experience
The majority of employees must feel threatened as they have two options:
1. Assume nothing will actually change and their knowledge and experience will continue to let them thrive
2. Fear that everything will come crashing down as neither their knowledge nor experience will be worth a damn a few years down the road

## Guiding Policy
1. valued higher than humbleness, experimentation and learning.
