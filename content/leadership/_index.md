In the dynamic world of business, finding the right leadership style can be a herculean task. But when we, as leaders, succeed in doing so, the rewards are immense.

Let's turn our attention to two remarkable leadership models: one from the realms of Silicon Valley and the other from the deck of a nuclear-powered submarine.

## The Power of Powerful Adults: A Page from Netflix's Playbook

In her book [*Powerful*](./powerful-patty-mccord/), former Netflix Chief Talent Officer Patty McCord shares the company’s radical approach to corporate culture. At the heart of this model is a simple, yet profound concept: treating employees as adults. But not just any adults, they are to be treated as **powerful** adults, possessing the power to make choices and drive results.

McCord asserts that empowerment isn't something an organization bestows upon its employees; rather, it is inherent in them. It's up to the company to create an environment that lets employees exercise their power. By doing so, you, as a leader, can unlock astonishing results.

How do you shape such an environment? Here are some key insights:

### Create a No-Rules Culture

Netflix's success largely hinges on its avoidance of unnecessary policies, processes, and rules. Instead, Netflix has created a culture where employees thrive in an environment of trust, autonomy, and responsibility. As leaders, our challenge is to strip away unnecessary bureaucracy and create spaces where talented employees can do their best work.

### Champion Transparency and Communication

Transparent communication underpins Netflix's no-rules culture. An open environment leads to a more collaborative and informed workforce. As leaders, let's open the channels of communication, make data and decision-making processes accessible, and foster a culture that values input from all.

### Aligning Employees with Company Goals

Successful leaders at Netflix align employees with the company's goals. By focusing on high performance and ensuring each individual understands their role, everyone contributes to the company's success. Clearly setting expectations and objectives, then giving employees the autonomy to achieve them is key.

## A Submarine Captain's Leadership Lesson: Intent-Based Leadership

While the high-tech corporate environment provides valuable insights, valuable leadership lessons also come from seemingly unrelated fields. L. David Marquet’s [*Turn the Ship Around!*](./turn-the-ship-around-l-david-marquet/) is one such treasure-trove. In it, Marquet shares his experience as a submarine captain and how it led to the development of the Intent-Based Leadership approach.

Marquet's core insight is that the traditional leader-follower model can lead to inefficiencies, lack of innovation, and disengagement. His solution? Turn followers into leaders by empowering decision-making at all levels.

Here are some strategies to implement this model:

### Giving Control, Rather Than Taking Control

Instead of directing every action, set expectations and trust your team members to make decisions. This approach allows for greater autonomy and promotes a sense of ownership, leading to increased motivation and engagement.

### Foster a Culture of Learning and Continuous Improvement

Creating an environment where mistakes are viewed as opportunities for growth rather than failures to be punished is essential. Encouraging feedback helps to identify areas for improvement and promotes a growth mindset among team members.

### Implement a Questioning Attitude

Promote a culture where individuals are encouraged to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and seek clarification when needed. This helps ensure that decisions are based on accurate information and fosters a more open, collaborative working environment.

### Prioritize Transparency and Open Communication

Share information freely within the team, ensuring everyone has access to the knowledge they need to make informed decisions. Transparent communication helps to build trust, foster collaboration, and promote a more effective decision-making process.

## A Call to Action

The power of these innovative leadership models cannot be overstated. However, they aren't about quick fixes or temporary changes. They require a complete shift in mindset, a willingness to challenge traditional leadership models, and an openness to experiment.

As a senior leader or executive, you have the ability to shape your organization's future. Will you continue down the same path, or will you take the bold step to transform your leadership style and your organization's culture?

In this category, we'll dive deeper into these concepts, offering case studies, practical applications, and strategies to help you implement these ideas. Together, we'll embark on this journey of transformative leadership, seeking to create organizations where everyone has the power to innovate, to lead, and to succeed.
